        <div class="subheading mb-5">BiologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jennifer Lu and I am a 20-year-old undergraduate student with a major in Biology. I am currently attending the University of California, Riverside, and planning to graduate in June 2024. I am on the pre-med track hoping to become a surgeon one day. Becoming part of the medical field has always been my dream since I was a little child. I find it super interesting to learn about all the different types of medicine and cures with the help of advanced technology. Although I am not super certain of what I want to become in the future, the pre-med track is what I have been striving for since the start of college. I hope that I can get into medical school after I graduate in about two years but I know that it is very difficult and I have been stressing over it. I would talk to people about my career path and they all struggle and always think about whether what they want is achievable for them or if they should switch to a different path. I always wonder what would happen if I chose to switch to a different major or do something else instead and what my life would be with a little less stress. However, this is already a little too late for me since I have a plan for my future career and have no desire to switch it anytime soon at least. <br><br>

        I have always wanted to have two jobs when I grow up. My second job being a CEO of my own business company and to be specific, a boba company. I started drinking boba since I was a kid and liked the taste of the drink very much. I would always get boba as a topping with all my drinks because I like how chewy they are. I know they can be dangerous for children as they tend to swallow it rather than chew it first then swallow it. However, with caution and awareness, children should not get the boba topping until they are in they teens. Boba is the one thing that I have quite often and do not know what to do if there was a ban of boba. Boba drinks are an essential to a lot of people and can be considered as a necessity.<br><br>

        I am the youngest child of the family with an older sister of three years gap. I live with my sister and my mother who I dearly love and appreciate. I grew up in a family with constant love from everyone and constant support of my goals/dreams. I have people I can trust my life with and I am truly grateful of them. I would consider myself as a lucky person and will never forget that. I want to give back to the people who I love and loves me and would try my very best to succeed. Failure is not a word in my vocabulary and will not give up to anything I do.
